# SubsiGuard🛡️


> Weeding out the corruption in farmer data to ensure every subsidy reaches the roots, not the loopholes.

## 📄 Problem Statement
The Indian government spends over ₹70,000 crores annually on agricultural subsidies for fertilizers, seeds, and equipment through a network of dealers and cooperatives. However, a significant portion of these subsidies never reaches farmers. Dealers inflate beneficiary lists with ghost farmers, divert subsidized goods to the open market at higher prices, or create fake invoices for supplies never delivered. The distribution chain involves multiple intermediaries across districts, making it difficult to track whether subsidies actually benefit intended recipients.

## 💡 The Solution
Our solutions move the manual auditing to proactive, real-time fraud prevention. We integrate government datasets such as, Land Records and Point-of-Sale logs. System uses data triangulation to calculate and automatically flag purchases that exceed the needs of their specific landholding. We will be able to detect behavioral anomalies, i.e. ghost beneficiaries and illogical geospatial transactions by creating a 'digital lock' that identifies and blocks leakages at source, enables authorities to target high-risk dealers with precision and not random sampling.
